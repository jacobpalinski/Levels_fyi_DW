2021,"(a) Local income taxes are excluded. Eleven states have county- or city-level income taxes; the average rates expressed as a percentage of AGI within each jurisdiction are: 0.10% in Alabama; 0.36% in Indiana; 0.11% in Iowa; 1.29% in Kentucky; 2.18% in Maryland; 0.17% in Michigan; 0.22% in Missouri; 1.47% in New York; 1.59% in Ohio; and 1.15% in Pennsylvania. Data are not available in Delaware, where Wilmington imposes a municipal income tax. In California, Colorado, Kansas, New Jersey, Oregon, and West Virginia, some jurisdictions have payroll taxes, flat-rate wage taxes, or interest and dividend income taxes.
